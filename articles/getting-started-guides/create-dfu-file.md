# How To Create a .dfu file

To manually flash firmware using ST DFUSE tools, get a copy of ST DFUSE tools. Search for STSW-STM32080


  - Install the DFUSE tools
  - Download the devices firmware update .zip file
  - Repeat step 1 above
    

# Step One

  - Locate the devices Device_BlockStorage.c file 
  (The Netduino 3 file was located here:  https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter/blob/develop/targets/CMSIS-OS/ChibiOS/NETDUINO3_WIFI/common/Device_BlockStorage.c)
  - Find the BlockRegionInfo segment Start address and bytes per block
  Example: const BlockRegionInfo BlockRegions[] = 
  
{

    {
    
        0x08000000,                         // start address for block region
        
        4,                                  // total number of blocks in this region
        
        0x4000,                             // total number of bytes per block
        
        ARRAYSIZE_CONST_EXPR(BlockRange1),
        
        BlockRange1,
        
    },
    
  
- Start the STDFU File Manager and select the "I want to generate a .dfu file ...." radio button
- Select the "Muti BIN" button and select the nanoBooter.bin file from the firmware update .zip file. Enter the Start address from above into the "Address" textbox. Example: 8000000
- Press the "Add to List" button
- Next select the nanoCLR.bin file. Enter the Start address + bytes per block into the "Address" textbox. Example: 804000
- Press the "Add to List" button
- Press the "Generate" button

# Step Two

  - Start the DFUSE Demo Application 
  - Locate the .dfu file generated above.
  - Click the "Choose" button then  the "Update" button
  - Toggle the devices power
  - That's all we are done!
