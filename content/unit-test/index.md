# nanoFramework Unit Tests platform

nanoFramework offers a complete Unit Tests platform called `nanoFramework.TestPlatform`

## What is nanoFramework.TestPlatform

nanoFramework.TestPlatform is a Unit Test platform dedicated to nanoFramework! It has all the benefits of what you're used to when using Microsoft Test platform for .NET or XUnit or any other!

The framework includes multiple elements that are including in a single nuget!

- `nanoFramework.TestPlatform` which contains the attributes to decorate your code and the `Assert` classes to check that you're code is properly doing what's expected.
- `nanoFramework.UnitTestLauncher` which is the engine launching and managing the Unit Tests.
- `nanoFramework.TestAdapter` which is the Visual Studio Test platform adapter, allowing to have the test integration in Visual Studio.

The integration looks like that:

![test integration](../../images/test-integration-vs.jpg)

And the integration will point you up to your code for successful or failed tests:

![test integration failed](../../images/test-integration-vs-failed.jpg)

## Usage of nanoFramework.TestPlatform

Simply add the `nanoFramework.TestPlatform` nuget to your project and you're good to go!

![test nuget](../../images/test-nuget-test-framework.jpg)

Once you'll build your project, the tests will be automatically discovered:

![test discovered](../../images/test-discovered.jpg)

You can then run all the tests and you'll get the result:

![test success](../../images/test-success.jpg)

## Creating a new Visual Studio NFUnitTest project

You can as well simply create a new Visual Studio NFUnitTest project that will already contains all the needed elements.

## Detailed usage

You will find the [detailed usage](using-test-platform.md), [how to run the tests](running-tests.md) and the [constraints/limitations](constraints-limitations.md) of the platform in the other documents.
