#String.Format for numerics examples
##About this document
This document provides examples of numeric formatting in the **nanoFramework** CLR. The examples are part of the Unit Test Framework and can be found in the [CoreLibrary repository](https://github.com/nanoframework/CoreLibrary) as part of the [Arithmetic unit tests](https://github.com/nanoframework/CoreLibrary/blob/develop/Tests/NFUnitTestArithmetic/UnitTestFormat.cs).  When running the unit test for a specifier the example data is gathered and displayed in the Test Output after a successful test.
